## 🎯 Project Goals

Design a recommendation system that:
- Retrieves and processes book data
- Cleans and merges datasets
- Applies NLP and clustering techniques
- Deploys a user-friendly application via Streamlit on AWS

## 🌍 Domain

**Recommendation Systems** – Empowering readers, authors, libraries, and retailers with intelligent book suggestions.

---

## 💼 Business Use Cases

- **📖 Personalized Reading Experience:** Tailor book suggestions to user preferences.
- **🏢 Enhanced Library Systems:** Boost engagement in libraries and bookstores.
- **🖋️ Publisher Insights:** Help publishers and authors understand market trends.
- **📈 Reader Engagement:** Encourage deeper user interaction through personalized discovery.

## 🧭 Approach

### 1. **Data Preparation**
- Use two datasets containing book metadata and ratings.
- Merge based on shared attributes like title and author.

### 2. **Data Cleaning**
- Handle missing, inconsistent, or duplicate records.
- Standardize formats (e.g., genres, ratings).

### 3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Analyze genre trends, rating distributions, and publication patterns.
- Visualize top-rated books, most common genres, and more.

### 4. **NLP and Clustering**
- Apply NLP on book titles/descriptions to extract features.
- Use clustering (K-Means, DBSCAN) to group similar books.
- **Clustering Scores**
